# Code content
There are two folders with somewhat separate code.

Rita's folder contains the effort made so far with BAT code ([BAT](https://github.com/bat/bat)) to have a realistic DM exlusion limit. It only treats the detector as a counting experiment, so it needs to be improved. For more details see [Rita Readme](https://github.com/CYGNO-Analysis/Limit/tree/main/Rita)

Samuele's folder contains the effort made so far with BAT code to have a realistic neutrino feasibility study. It treats the detector with limited experimental effects but includes direction and energy information. For more details see [Samuele Readme](https://github.com/CYGNO-Analysis/Limit/tree/main/Samuele)

Ideally the two should not be splitted but include one the features of the other.
